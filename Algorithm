Divide the speech signals into Hamming windowed frames.
The following operations are to be done framewise:
Perform LPC analysis. Plot the DFT spectrum and LPC spectrum on the same plot.
Obtain the inverse filter.
Using the inverse filter, obtain the LPC residual signal.
Use the LPC residual to excite the LPC filter and produce a (synthetic) speech frame.
Perform overlap-add to obtain back the speech signal. Play back the speech signal.
