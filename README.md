# LPC-of-Speech-Signal
LPC is a very powerful speech analysis technique used to estimate basic speech parameters. It provides extremely accurate estimation of speech parameters.
In LPC, Speech Signals can be approximated as linear combination of past samples by minimizing the error. This has been done by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the actual speech samples and the predicted ones
LPC is useful and most powerful for audio and speech signal processing and also it reduces the bit rate. It is used as a form of voice compression by phone companies for example GSM standard.
